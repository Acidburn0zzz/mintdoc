"Linux Mint can be thought of as filling the same role as Microsoft's "
"Windows, Apple's Mac OS, and the free BSD OS. Linux Mint is also designed to "
"work in conjunction with other operating systems (including those listed "
"above), and can automatically set up a <wordasword>dual boot</wordasword> or "
"<wordasword>multi-boot</wordasword> environment (where the user is prompted "
"as to which operating system to start at each boot-up) during its "
"installation."
