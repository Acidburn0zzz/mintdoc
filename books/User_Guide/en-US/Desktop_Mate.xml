        <title>The Welcome Screen</title>
        <para>The first time you start your newly installed Mate desktop (and every other time until you
        choose to uncheck the checkbox on the bottom) you'll see the Welcome Screen. You can
        also find this screen when scrolling to the bottom of the Preferences menu or by starting
        to type &ldquo;Wel&rdquo; in the Search-bar.</para>

        <para>Do take a look at this screen, it has a lot of interesting links!! You can find a link to the
        User guide there (yeah I know, you're already reading it). But also you can put the
        information of your machine in the Hardware database. Or you can ask questions in the
        Forums (or answer them of course). And Important information is Important too!</para>
