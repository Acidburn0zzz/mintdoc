"There's a lot more to learn about Linux Mint and about Linux in general. "
"This guide was just an overview of some of the aspects related to your "
"desktop. By now you should feel more comfortable with using it and you "
"should have a better understanding of some of its components. Where are you "
"going to go next? Will you learn how to use the terminal? Will you give "
"other desktops a try? It's entirely up to you. Remember, Linux is about fun "
"and the community is there to help. Take your time and learn a little bit "
"every day. There's always something new no matter how much you know already."
