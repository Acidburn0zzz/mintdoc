"Most people are used to clicking on the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu or to "
"right clicking on the content they want to copy. In Linux Mint you can do "
"this as well, but you can also copy and paste content from the comfort of "
"your mouse. Here's how it works: The left button of the mouse copies and the "
"middle button pastes. It's as simple as that!"

"Let's give it a try. Launch LibreOffice Writer or a text editor, or any "

"your mouse. Think you need to click on the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu and "
"press <guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem>? No? Bet you're thinking you would use "
"a combination of keys on your keyboard such as "
"<keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>C</keycap></keycombo>. In Linux, it "
"is much simpler. Just by selecting the text, you've already copied it. "
"That's right... that text is now copied to your mouse buffer and you don't "
"need to press anything else."

"The buffer used by the mouse is not the same as the one used by the desktop. "
"So you can actually copy something with your mouse and copy something else "
"with <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>C</keycap></keycombo> or with "
"the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu. Thanks to this you can copy two elements "
"at a time and depending on how you copied them you can paste them with "
"either the middle mouse button or with "
"<keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>V</keycap></keycombo> or the "
"<guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu."

"We all take notes. Whether it's an address given by someone over the phone, "
"an ever-growing TODO list or some particular thing to remember, we're often "
"faced with the situation where we need to take a quick note. Some of us have "
"a lot of written notes around our computers and never seem to find a working "
"pen when the situation arises, others waste time in launching tools that are "
"not suitable for this particular use (LibreOffice Writer for instance is not "
"very handy to take notes) and very few people actually use software "
"dedicated to note-taking. Linux Mint happens to include a dedicated note-"
"taking tool. It is called Tomboy Notes."
