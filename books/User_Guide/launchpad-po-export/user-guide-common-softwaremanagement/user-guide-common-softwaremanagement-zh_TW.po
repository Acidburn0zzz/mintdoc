"Software is first written by a developer, as you might expect, and this end "

"furthest point downstream, but you knew that because you're an admin). Once "
"the developer is happy with the program or the update to the program they "
"have written, they will release the source code for it. They will also "
"communicate in their documentation which data libraries or other programs "
"they took advantage of when they were writing the program. They have been "
